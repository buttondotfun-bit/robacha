/**
 * Tokens lined up for the machine that are not in it yet.
 *
 * What is *already* in the machine is never listed here — that half is read
 * live from the pool contract, so it cannot drift out of date or claim a token
 * the machine does not actually hold. This file is only for the ones we intend
 * to add, which is a statement about the future and therefore cannot be read
 * from anywhere.
 *
 * Two rules keep that honest:
 *
 *   1. Every address here has had `symbol()` checked against its ticker on
 *      Robinhood Chain. Several tickers have multiple contracts using them —
 *      HOODRAT alone has six — and shipping the wrong one would mean the
 *      AutoBuyer buying an impostor and handing it out as a prize.
 *   2. No odds, amounts or dates. Those do not exist until a pool version is
 *      published with the token in it, and inventing them to make a card look
 *      finished would put fabricated product values on a site whose whole
 *      promise is that every figure comes from a contract.
 *
 * `allowlisted` reflects `allowlistedTokens()` on the registry at the time of
 * writing and is re-read live by the component, never trusted from here.
